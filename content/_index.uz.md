### Localization

Duckquill ships with a localization system based on one used in [tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi), it's very easy to use and quite flexible at the same time.

To add a translation, simply create a file in your site's `i18n` directory called `LANG_CODE.toml`, e.g `fr.toml`. The language code should be either [ISO 639-1](https://localizely.com/iso-639-1-list/) or [BCP 47](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry).

Inside that file, copy-paste one of the existing translations from Duckquill and adapt it to your needs. You can also check [tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi/tree/main/i18n) translation files for reference.

Additionally to translating Duckquill, you can also override the English stings by copy-pasting `en.toml` from Duckquill to the `i18n` directory of your website and adjusting the values to your liking. -->
